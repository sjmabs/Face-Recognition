# Face-Recognition
Final project for ZTM Course
React front end that uses AI to detect faces in given images.

This works in line with the back end so in order for it to work you will need to have both this and the Face-Recognition-API.

Firstly, Clone the Face-Recognition-API repo and follow the READ ME then come back here.

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`
